# ZhuaTech Mail Agent

> A source-available enterprise project by [ZhuaTech](https://www.zhuatech.cn/) for enterprise AI-assisted workflows with human governance.

ZhuaTech Mail Agent provides a practical, self-hosted foundation for enterprise AI-assisted workflows with human governance. It is designed for business operators, domain reviewers, AI teams, and administrators, with clear business records, controlled workflows, operational visibility, and auditable actions.

This repository is intended for learning, technical evaluation, and non-commercial collaboration. The included implementation, tests, database resources, and container configuration provide a reproducible starting point for further enterprise adaptation.

**Search topics:** enterprise mailagent, self-hosted mailagent, Java Spring Boot enterprise software, digital transformation.

## Product Scope

- **Primary users:** Business operators, domain reviewers, AI teams, and administrators.
- **Deployment model:** Self-hosted, with container-based local deployment where supported.
- **Governance baseline:** Role-aware operations, validation, approval boundaries, exception handling, and auditability.
- **Production boundary:** Review security, identity, backup, observability, capacity, and compliance controls before production use.

## Capability Map

- **Mail Assistant Task** — Manage mail assistant task with ownership, validation, and explicit lifecycle states.
- **Analysis Task** — Coordinate analysis task through controlled workflows and approval gates.
- **Audit Log** — Track audit log metrics, exceptions, deadlines, and follow-up actions.
- **Structured business inputs** — Preserve structured business inputs evidence in searchable, traceable operational history.
- **Rule-based local execution mode** — Expose rule-based local execution mode in role-aware user and administration workspaces.
- **Provider-neutral AI integration interface** — Connect provider-neutral ai integration interface to external systems through configurable integration boundaries.

## Technology Baseline

**Technology stack:** Java 21 · Spring Boot · Responsive HTML5 · MySQL 8 · Docker Compose

### Repository Layout

- `backend/` — Java backend, domain services, APIs, validation, and automated tests
- `frontend/` — responsive user and administration interfaces
- `database/` — database schema, migrations, or demonstration data
- `deploy/` — deployment and operations resources
- `docs/` — architecture, operations, screenshots, and supporting documentation
- `compose.yaml` — local multi-service orchestration

## Run Locally

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

- Review `compose.yaml` before changing published ports, storage paths, or production credentials.

## Verification

Run the checks supported by this repository before changing or deploying it:

```bash
cd backend && mvn test
```

## Security and Production Readiness

- Never commit real passwords, API keys, tokens, certificates, customer data, or production connection strings.
- Replace all local demonstration credentials and secrets before deployment.
- Apply least privilege, tenant isolation, backup and restore drills, monitoring, rate limiting, and vulnerability management.
- AI-related features must retain human review, provider configuration, traceability, and safe fallback behavior.
- Please report security issues privately through the contact channels below instead of publishing sensitive details.
